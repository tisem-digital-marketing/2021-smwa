**Hints / Tips / Typos**:

!!! bug "Typo / Inconsistency in Variable Names"

    In **Question 6** of Group Assignment 1 we write "Create a data frame with two rows and two columns where the rows take the values of after = 0 or 1, and the columns take the values of ta_dummy = 0 or 1".

    While conceptually this is correct -- Proserpio and Zervas use weird variable names that make it unclear what to do here. 

    So to "do" the exercise it should be "**Create a data frame with two rows and two columns where the rows take the values of first_response = 0 or 1, and the columns take the values of ta_dummy = 0 or 1**."
