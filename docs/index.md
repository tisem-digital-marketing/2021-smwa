# Welcome!

Welcome to the course website for **Social Media and Web Analytics** at TiSEM in **2021**.

This course introduces students to recent developments in the online marketing landscape - with an emphasis on social media and user generated content (UGC).

There are two overarching objectives:

1. Learning/delivering marketing insights from state of the art research in social media marketing,
2. Improving analytics & coding skills.

*We want you to develop the knowledge and skills that we would want you to have if we were hiring you to work in a social media analytics team.*
