# Announcements

Important announcements will be posted here to avoid our inboxes getting clogged up.

If you have questions - direct them to us via [Slack](https://tisem-smwa.slack.com/). There's a 'Direct Message' feature so you can contact us individually as needed, but where possible post messages to a channel that all participants can see.

    Welcome to the course "Social Media and Web Analytics."

    Please take a look around the [course website](https://tisem-digital-marketing.github.io/2021-smwa/) before the course begins. All the latest information about the course material, course structure and any additional information are available on these pages.

    We particularly draw your attention to the following:

    * The class is **mostly asynchronous**. But we will have "live" Discussion Sections each week. See the [Schedule](../schedule) for details 
    * **[Pre-Course Survey](https://forms.gle/sqqjx1kmasjH8QHJ7)**.
        * Please fill this out before the course begins.

    * [**Course Preparation**](../course_prep). Work through these materials to help you prepare for the course. There are some course introduction videos and links to DataCamp material to prepare you for the analytics/coding components of this class.
        * You won't need to install software on your computer to work through the DataCamp material.
            * We recommend working through the DataCamp Modules before starting the software installation 
            * See the power of the toolkit, *then* bring it to your computer

    *  **[Installation Guide](../software_install)**. These pages walk you through the steps needed to install all the software for the course.
        * We expect you to have completed it before the course begins.
            * Note that we expect you have attempted to complete the guide yourself. We have [office hours](../software_install) to provide some help when it is needed.
            * The guide is modular in nature - with most steps being independent of those before and after.


    To avoid clogging up everyone's inboxes with course email, all future important information will be posted on the course's [Announcements page](.) - be sure to check in there regularly. Smaller pieces of information and course chat will take place inside a chat environment, called [Slack](https://www.slack.com). Sign up to join the conversation [here](https://tisem-smwa.slack.com/signup#/).

    We look forward to seeing you at our kick off meeting on Tuesday April 13, at 12:45pm. 
    A Zoom link will be distributed closer to the session.

    Best,

    Lachlan and Hendrik
