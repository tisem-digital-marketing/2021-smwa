To succeed in this course you will need to be willing to get your hands dirty and learn some new coding skills.
We will need you to have acquired some basic coding skills before the course begins, and have curated some resources for you to work through so that we all begin the class from the same set of building blocks.

Please work through the following content before the course begins to build up your basic coding toolkit:

1. Complete the [software installation guide](../software_install).
2. Completion of DataCamp modules on `R`, Version Control with Git, and some command line basics. See below for specifics.
3. Work through [How to Use Git/Github with R][git-r].
