Our goal is to create the best possible community for becoming a a better marketer and a better coder. We want every member of the Social Media and Web Analytics community to be able to focus their full attention on these goals. This is impossible to do if you are being harassed, stalked, or discriminated against. Accordingly, all students, faculty, and invited guests are expected to show respect and courtesy to each other in all interactions, whether in person, in our online community, or in other contexts. To make sure that everyone has a common understanding of \"show respect and courtesy to each other,\" we have adopted the following code of conduct. The code of conduct is enforced by the course instructors. Report a violation here . Unacceptable behavior The following types of behavior are unacceptable in our course, both online and in-person, and constitute code of conduct violations. Abusive behavior Harassment - including offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion, as well as sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual or romantic attention. Threats - threatening someone physically or verbally. For example, threatening to publicize sensitive information about someone's personal life. Unwelcoming behavior Blatant -isms \u2014saying things that are explicitly racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. For example, arguing that some people are less intelligent because of their gender, race or religion. Subtle -isms and small mistakes made in conversation are not code of conduct violations. However, repeating something after it has been pointed out to you that you broke a social rule, or antagonizing or arguing with someone who has pointed out your subtle -ism is considered unwelcoming behavior, and is not allowed in our course. Maliciousness towards other course participants - deliberately attempting to make others feel bad, name-calling, singling out others for derision or exclusion. For example, telling someone they\u2019re not a real marketer / programmer or that they don\u2019t belong in our course. Being especially unpleasant - for example, if we've received reports from multiple students or faculty of annoying, rude, or especially distracting behavior. Bringing guests into the course space - you may not bring non-course participants into the our course spaces except in very specific contexts. It\u2019s important that everyone can trust that only other course participants will be in the space - it allows people to speak freely, feel comfortable leaving their belongings unattended, and trust that everyone is being held to the expectations in this code of conduct. This is different from all the rest, but is nevertheless a code of conduct violation. Behavior that jeopardizes Social Media and Web Analytics' credibilitys While the class is a learning community, it's also a community of friends. We ask you to be aware of the fact that conversations that may be appropriate within the context of a specific friendship or relationship with another course participant may be inappropriate in the our course spaces or in a group conversation with course participants you don't know well. Scope Students, faculty and invited guests are held to the standards outlined in this code of conduct when interacting in-person, and online on the course's tools like Zoom, Slack, Canvas and GitHub. When in doubt, please report unacceptable behavior to us. If someone's behavior outside of the confines of our course spaces makes you feel unsafe within them, that is absolutely relevant and actionable for us. Enforcement We've categorized unacceptable behavior into abuse, unwelcoming behavior, and behavior that jeopardizes our classes credibility in the sections above. If we witness or receive a report about abusive behavior, we will contact the perpetrator to have a conversation with them and verify what has transpired. We will also report the behaviour to the appropriate contacts at Tilburg University where the university administration can decide on the next steps. If we witness or receive a report about unwelcoming behavior or behavior that jeopardizes us as a class, we will contact the course participant involved to explain why their behavior was unacceptable, and warn them that a second code of conduct violation will result in further action. This is the protocol that the instructors will use to respond to reports of code of conduct violations. Reporting If you see a violation of our code of conduct, please report it to the course instructors. Why should I report? You are responsible for making the course a safe and comfortable space for everyone. Everyone in our community shares this responsibility. Instructors are not around the to observe all interactions relevant to our course so we cannot enforce the code of conduct without your help. The consequences for the course community of not reporting bad behavior outweigh the consequences for one person of reporting it. Where and how to report Please report all code of conduct violations via the reporting form . If you would rather discuss the matter in person with a faculty member, book office hours with one of us on the calendar, or email us to schedule a time to talk. In your report, please include: Your name - this is incredibly helpful for us to be able to follow up with you, and ask questions to better understand the situation. The form allows you to report anonymously. Please only use this option if you really need to, and know that we might not be able to take action without knowing who you are. A detailed description of what happened If the violation happened online, please link to or send us the relevant text. If the violation happened in person, please detail what exactly the other person said or did. In order to take action, we need to know the concrete actions that someone took. Where and when the incident happened Any other relevant context. Do you have examples of a pattern of similar behavior from this person before? D o you have a relationship with this person outside of the class? If/how you\u2019ve already responded - this lets us know the current state of the situation. Confidentiality We will keep all reports confidential, except if we've discussed with you and agreed otherwise. When we discuss incidents with people who are reported, we will anonymize details as much as we can to protect reporter privacy. However, some incidents happen in one-on-one interactions, and even if the details are anonymized, the reported person may be able to guess who made the report. If you have concerns about retaliation or your personal safety, and do not want us to share the details of your report with anyone (including the perpetrator) please let us know explicitly in your report. Unfortunately, in that situation we may not be able to take any action. In some cases we may decide to share an update about a major incident with current course participants. If that's the case, the identities will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise. Social rules In addition to having a code of conduct, we have four lightweight social rules . The social rules are different and separate from the code of conduct. They help us create a better learning environment by giving names to counterproductive behavior and acting as a release valve so that frustration doesn't build up over time. We expect people to unintentionally break the social rules from time to time. Doing this doesn't make you a bad person. When this happens, it's not a big deal. Take the approach of apologizing and moving on. The enforcement provisions in this code of conduct do not apply to the social rules. We definitely won't give you a strong warning or report you to University administration for these. If you have any questions about any part of the code of conduct or social rules, please reach out to the course instructors.","title":"Code of Conduct"},{"location":"conduct/#why-have-a-code-of-conduct","text":"Our goal is to create the best possible community for becoming a a better marketer and a better coder.

They help create a friendly, intellectual environment where you can spend as much of your energy as possible on learning. The social rules are: No well-actually\u2019s No feigned surprise No backseat driving No subtle -isms We expect people to break the social rules from time to time. If you do, apologise and we'll move on. This means the social rules are different and totally separate from our code of conduct . No well-actually\u2019s Alice: I just installed Linux on my computer! Bob: It\u2019s actually called GNU/Linux. A well-actually is when you correct someone about something that's not relevant to the conversation or tangential to what they're trying to say. They're bad because they aren\u2019t helpful, break the flow of conversation, and focus attention on the person making the well actually. This rule can be a bit tricky because there isn't a clear line between relevant to the conversation and not. Sometimes your correction might actually be necessary, and it could still come off as annoying when you make it. The best rule of thumb is, if you\u2019re not sure whether something needs to be said right now, hold off and see what happens. You can always say it later if it turns out there\u2019s no way for the conversation to move forward without your correction. No feigning surprise Dan: What\u2019s the command line? Carol: Wait, you\u2019ve never used the command line? Feigned surprise is when you act surprised when someone doesn't know something. Responding with surprise in this situation makes people feel bad for not knowing things and less likely to ask questions in the future, which makes it harder for them to learn. No feigning surprise isn\u2019t a great name. When someone acts surprised when you don't know something, it doesn't matter whether they're pretending to be surprised or actually surprised. The effect is the same: the next time you have a question, you\u2019re more likely to keep your mouth shut. An accurate name for this rule would be no acting surprised when someone doesn\u2019t know something, but it's a mouthful, and at this point, the current name has stuck. No backseat driving Bob: What\u2019s the name of the the concept that summarizes x,y and and z? Alice: Concept Name. Eve: (from across the room) You should use the term 'A' instead. It\u2019s broader. Backseat driving is when you lob advice from across the room (or across the online chat) without really joining or engaging in a conversation. Because you haven't been participating in the conversation, it\u2019s easy to miss something important and give advice that\u2019s not actually helpful. Even if your advice is correct, it's rude to bust into a conversation without asking. If you overhear a conversation where you could be helpful, the best thing to do is to ask to join. No subtle -isms Carol: Windows is hard to use. Bob: No way. Windows is so easy to use that even my mom can use it. Subtle -isms are subtle expressions of racism, sexism, ageism, homophobia, transphobia and other kinds of bias and prejudice. They are small things that make others feel unwelcome, things that we all sometimes do by mistake. Subtle -isms make people feel like they don\u2019t belong at in our learning environment. We want to create an environment where everyone can focus all their energy on learning. That is hard to do that if you're regularly being made to wonder whether you belong. Subtle -isms can also be things that you do instead of say. This includes things like boxing out the only woman at the whiteboard during a discussion or assuming someone isn't a good coder because of their race or gender. The fourth social rule is more complicated than the others. Not everyone agrees on what constitutes a subtle -ism. Subtle -isms are baked into society in ways that can make them hard to recognize. And not everyone experiences subtle -isms in the same way: subtle homophobia won\u2019t hurt someone who's straight in the same way it hurts someone who's gay. There's another part of no subtle -isms: If you see racism, sexism, etc. outside of our class, please don't bring it in. For example, please don\u2019t start a discussion about the latest offensive comment from Random Person Y. Everyone who comes to our class should have the same opportunity to focus on learning, and people from oppressed groups often find discussions of racism, sexism, etc. particularly hard to tune out. There are many places to discuss and debate these issues, but there are few where people can avoid them. This class is one of those places. How do the Social Rules work? The social rules are lightweight. You should not be afraid of breaking a social rule. These are things that everyone does, and breaking one doesn\u2019t make you a bad person. If someone says, \"hey, you just feigned surprise,\" or \"that's subtly sexist,\" don't worry. Just apologize, reflect for a second, and move on. The social rules aren't for punishing people. They help make our class a pleasant environment where you are free to be yourself, tackle things outside your comfort zone, and focus on learning. Code of Conduct The social rules don't cover harassment or discrimination. For that, we have a separate code of conduct enforced by the course instructors. All members of the Social Media and Web Analytics community are expected to abide by our code of conduct . Hat-tip We've borrowed these social rules from The Recurse Centre . We think they encapsulate the most important rules to create a friendly and productive learning environment, and we hope you do too.","title":"Social Rules"},{"location":"social_rules/#social-rules","text":"Social Media and Web Analytics has four social rules.
